In my previous career in the contracts kitchen design industry I often found opportunities where I could put my self-taught spreadsheet skills to good use and practice my creativity and problem solving skills to create various tools. This increasingly became my passion and sparked my interest in software engineering. 
Initially learning the basics, I fell in love with coding and felt like I was discovering my superpower. I soon enrolled on a full time software engineering bootcamp with General Assembly where at a fast pace, I delved much deeper into the world of coding and began to learn the industry standards.   
I am extremely excited about the possibilities and challenges that this career change presents and I am very eager to be part of an industry that makes such an impact on everything we do. I am looking for opportunities where I can continue to grow and develop my skills in a fast paced environment and challenge myself.
